            <p>Augmented reality (AR) is a branch of virtual reality (VR) and is a computer graphic technique that synthesizes virtual objects or information in the environment that actually exists so that they look like objects that exist in the original
                environment

            <p>Legacy system refers to old technology or methodology, computer system, software, etc. This may even be a term used by modern times, but it may not be used anymore, but it may also affect modern technology. For example, the Space Shuttle of
                the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration continued to use parts that used technology when they were first made. Because it was too expensive to develop new parts while meeting conditions such as stability, most of them have
                been made using 1970s technology. Many software developers think there are potential problems with using legacy systems.[1] For example, for software designed for older hardware, it may be necessary to implement emulation or subcompatibility
                to make it run on new hardware.</p>
